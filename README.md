# KidneyStoneClassification

Code for my bachelor thesis project done as a collaboration between the university of groningen and the institut mathematique de bordeaux on kidney stone classification using endoscopic images. 

The data used is not a publically available dataset, as such I cannot share it. 

The core of the project was to use a ResNet 152v2 and test state of the art techniques, such as multi-task learning to classify/diagnose types of kidney stones.
